For controlling an Android device remotely,
you may use https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
whose implementation is [explained](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/ed84e18b1ae3e51d368f8c7bc88ba4db088e6855/DEVELOP.md).

An [alternative tool](https://github.com/MajeurAndroid/java-adb-remote-screen) exists,
less maintained,
in Java,
not supporting macOS.
